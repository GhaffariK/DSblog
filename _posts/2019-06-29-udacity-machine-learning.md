In this post I share my initial thoughts on Udacity Intro to Machine Learning online course after completing two of its lessons.

I was introduced to Udacity's Machine Learning course while reading [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-path-for-you-to-learn-analytics-and-data-skills-bd48ccde7325/). This course consists of 17 lessons and at first glance seems to cover many core and interesting aspects of machine learning. These are my first impressions after completing lesson one, the introduction and lesson two Naive Bayes. 
* The course has a casual format; Some of the instructions made by Sebsatian Thrun and Caitlin Malone takes place in an operating Google self driving car, a product made possible through utilizing machine learning which is encouraging. At times however, the interactions are distracting and might feel unneeded.

* The course’s attempt in explaining many concepts is not well-organized and it fails to provide the defining core explanation to the subject. After taking the lesson you will probably be able to intuitively tell if an algorithm is supervised correctly in most cases. But you won’t be confident about what a supervised algorithm really is, and at what point it becomes unsupervised. 

* It gets you started on Machine learning. It makes sure you know how to call the Gaussian Naive Bayes form Scikit-Learn library, how to fit it to your training data and how to predict the result for the test data. You will write down these few lines multiple times by the end of the lesson, and will remember it, hopefully for a decent amount of time.

It seems the course strives to cover many of the essential concepts in machine learning; a definite plus for those who want to get started quickly and don’t have the luxury to take their time. This however will make the lessons feel rushed. I will be posting my impressions of this course one more time after completing all the 17 lessons.
